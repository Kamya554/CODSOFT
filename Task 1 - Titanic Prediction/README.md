# Task 1 - Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This is Task 1 of my Data Science Internship with **CodSoft**.  
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features like age, gender, class, fare, and more.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the classic **Titanic dataset** available on Kaggle:
- `train.csv` – used to train the model
- `test.csv` – used to test predictions
- `gender_submission.csv` – sample submission for reference

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Predict the **survival of passengers** aboard the Titanic based on features like:

- Passenger Class (`Pclass`)
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)
- Parch (Parents/Children aboard)
- Fare
- Embarked location

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

---

## 🧠 ML Model

The following steps were performed:

1. Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
2. Feature Selection
3. Model Building (Logistic Regression)
4. Model Evaluation using accuracy score

---

## 📈 Results

Achieved good accuracy using Logistic Regression.  
Evaluation metrics like confusion matrix and accuracy were used.

# Task 2 - Movie Rating Prediction 🎬

This is Task 2 of my Data Science Internship with **CodSoft**.  
In this project, I built a machine learning model using Python to predict the IMDb rating of Indian movies based on features like genre, director, and actors.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project was taken from Kaggle:

🔗 [IMDb India Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies)

It contains features such as:

- Movie Title
- Genre
- Director
- Actors
- Year
- Runtime
- Rating (target column)

---

## 🎯 Objective

To train a **regression model** that can predict the **IMDb rating** of a movie based on selected input features.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Label encoding of categorical columns (e.g., genre, director)
2. **Feature Selection**
3. **Model Training**
   - Linear Regression
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - R² Score
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
5. **Visualization**
   - Plotting Actual vs Predicted Ratings

---

## 📈 Results

The model was evaluated using R² Score and RMSE to determine how well it predicted movie ratings.  
A scatter plot was used to visually compare the predicted vs actual ratings.
